# Given data from the image
X = np.array([[0, 0], [2, 0], [0, -1], [0, 2], [0, 3]])

n_features = X.shape[1]

# In a standard QP problem for support vector machines, we have:
# Minimize (1/2) * x^T * P * x + q^T * x
# Subject to G * x <= h
# and A * x = b
# Here x is the vector of variables (weights in SVM), and for SVM, P is X^T * X and q is -1.

# For SVM, P should be computed as (X^T * X) element-wise multiplied by (y * y^T)
# This ensures that P contains the correct coefficients for the quadratic optimization problem.
P = np.outer(y, y) * np.dot(X, X.T)

# q is a vector of -1's of size equal to the number of training samples.
q = -np.ones_like(y)

# Since we don't have any inequality constraints for this problem, G and h will be empty
G = np.zeros((1, n_features))
h = np.zeros(1)

# We also don't have any equality constraints for this problem, so A and b will be empty as well
A = np.zeros((1, n_features))
b = np.zeros(1)

# Now we solve the QP problem using the qpsolvers package
x = solve_qp(P, q, G, h, A, b, solver='cvxopt')
